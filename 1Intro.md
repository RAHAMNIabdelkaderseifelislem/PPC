# What's Constraint Programming?

Constraint programming is a programming paradigm that uses constraints to solve problems. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means that the programmer specifies the problem to be solved, but not the algorithm to solve it. The constraint programming paradigm is based on the idea that a problem can be solved by restricting the possible solutions to the problem. The programmer specifies the constraints that the solution must satisfy, and the constraint solver finds a solution that satisfies all the constraints.

## how to know that a problem is a constraint problem?

The problem is a constraint problem if it can be solved by restricting the possible solutions to the problem. The programmer specifies the constraints that the solution must satisfy, and the constraint solver finds a solution that satisfies all the constraints.

## diffrence between logic programming and imperative programming and functional programming and object-oriented programming

### logic programming

Logic programming is a programming paradigm that uses logic to solve problems. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means that the programmer specifies the problem to be solved, but not the algorithm to solve it. The logic programming paradigm is based on the idea that a problem can be solved by restricting the possible solutions to the problem. The programmer specifies the constraints that the solution must satisfy, and the logic solver finds a solution that satisfies all the constraints.

### imperative programming

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

### functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means that the programmer specifies the problem to be solved, but not the algorithm to solve it. The functional programming paradigm is based on the idea that a problem can be solved by restricting the possible solutions to the problem. The programmer specifies the constraints that the solution must satisfy, and the functional solver finds a solution that satisfies all the constraints.

### object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1] There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.
